# Verilog HDL
This repository contains all the verilog codes of combinational and seqeuntial circuits along with some applications.


## 1. Basic Gates 

The basic gates are : 
```mermaid
graph TD;
Gates-->NOT;
Gates-->AND;
Gates-->OR;
Gates-->NAND;
Gates-->NOR;
Gates-->XOR;
Gates-->XNOR;
```
The simulation results for the basic gates are shown in the images below.
